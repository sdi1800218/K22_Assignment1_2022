How much I miss
How much I miss your hot embrace
as the summers cut me like knifes
I miss you and I can't stand freezing
I feel I am finished
Where to find you, to tell you I love you
Where to find you, what way to live
I miss you and I freeze
I feel I am finished
How much I miss your hot embrace
as the summers cut me like knifes
I miss you and I can't stand freezing
I feel I am finished
Where to find you, to tell you I love you
Where to find you, what way to live
I miss you and I freeze
I feel I am finished
I miss you and I look inside the summers, it snows, it rains
and stars are falling
How much I miss your hot embrace
Where to find you, to tell you I love you
Where to find you, what way to live
I miss you and I freeze
I feel I am finished
How much I miss your hot embrace
as the summers cut me like knifes
I miss you and I can't stand freezing
I feel I am finished
